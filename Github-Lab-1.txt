Github Lab 1: Collaboration

Instructions: In this lab we will play a game of literary ‘exquisite corpse’. The idea is we will write a story where each student writes one paragraph of the story based on the last paragraph. 

For this assignment please edit this file by opening it into a text program like TextEdit / Microsoft Word. Please keep the story PG. No use of cursing, racism, sexist, homophobia, intense graphic violence imagery, overt sexual speech will be tolerated. When you start your paragraph please write your name at the top.

When you are done with the paragraph please separate your section by using the a line of underscores. You can do this by holding shift + hypen (-)

I have a pet called Bently. He is so cute and clever. He is a vegetarian, He can’t eat meat because of his health problem.

Poor Bently, cast reluctantly into vegetarianism he tends to act out. He likes to stick his paws in the fish bowl and attempt to catch our pet fish. Don’t worry, when he catches her, he always lets her go.

Of course this is a traumatizing experience for our fish. Even though she is always released, the stress of the encounters has made her anxious and constantly on edge. When we drop food in the bowl, she’ll hide until it floats down to her.

But one day, she decided she was going to fight back. Our fish, Andy, decided that today would be different. When Bently’s paw came rushing down the fish bowl, Andy jumped up and used her tail to smack Bently right in his whiskers. done

Andy the fish was victorious-- but now there was a new problem! The adrenaline rush from smacking Bently almost made her forget that she can't be out of water for too long! She had jumped so high and so forcefully that she splashed out of her bowl. Thankfully, her owner was there to quickly scoop Andy back into her fishbowl.

It was a mesmerizing image to see Andy back to her environment. A pristine blue water that blended well with her beautiful, innocent swimming style. No human being could possibly be close to her elegance, even in the fishbowl.

Since Bently couldn’t eat Andy, I decided to fix him a delicious vegetarian meal of tofu, peas, sweet potatoes, and apples. Bently loves this meal. We eat it together before attending PETA meetings.

Let’s get back to the main character, Bently.  Just imagine his present state of mind.  A carnivore turns a vegan because of a health problem.  As if it is not humiliating enough.  He just got smacked by a pet fish.  His little heart must have been broken into thousand pieces.  To Bently, this is the fabled “wish upon a star” moment.  How about we all pull for Bently for a change.
